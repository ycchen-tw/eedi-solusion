        "response": "In this study, we propose a novel Direct Search Method (DSM) for solving the Economic Dispatch Problem (EDP) incorporating the Valve-Point Effect (VPE). The DSM efficiently optimizes the allocation of generation among power units considering nonlinear characteristics induced by VPE. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the DSM in minimizing the total generation cost while satisfying operational constraints. The proposed method presents a promising approach for enhancing the economic operation of power systems amidst valve-point effects."

        "response": "This research investigates the application of machine learning algorithms to detect distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks within software-defined networks (SDNs). Leveraging the flexibility and programmability of SDNs, we propose a novel approach that integrates machine learning techniques to identify and mitigate DDoS attacks effectively. Through extensive experimentation, we evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms in accurately detecting and classifying DDoS attacks. Our findings highlight the efficacy of machine learning-based solutions in enhancing the security of SDNs against malicious cyber threats."

        "response": "This study explores methods for discovering social circles within ego networks, focusing on the identification of cohesive groups of individuals and their interconnections. Leveraging graph-theoretical approaches and community detection algorithms, we propose a novel framework for automatically detecting social circles embedded in ego networks. Through empirical analysis on real-world social network datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately uncovering meaningful social structures. Our findings contribute to advancing our understanding of social network dynamics and fostering insights into community formation processes within ego networks."
