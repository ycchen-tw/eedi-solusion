In this paper, we propose a novel approach utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to enhance the resilience of smart grids against cyber attacks. Our method leverages DRL agents to dynamically optimize intrusion detection and response strategies based on real-time grid conditions and attack patterns. We demonstrate through simulations on a realistic smart grid testbed that our approach effectively reduces the impact of cyber threats while maintaining grid operational efficiency and reliability. The results highlight significant improvements in security posture compared to traditional rule-based and anomaly detection approaches.",
